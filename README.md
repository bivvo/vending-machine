2 hours to make a quick vending machine application. This product is using .net core 6 and Angular 16. 
To use run
dotnet run in VendingMachine.Api
and ng serve in the VendingMachine.UI

This product is very incomplete due to limited time and having not worked with the latest version of Angular. The older version (AngularJS) is severly deprecated
and out of date.
